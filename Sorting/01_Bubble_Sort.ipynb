    "\n",
    "2. **Small Datasets**: Effective for sorting very small lists (fewer than 10 elements) where efficiency is less critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Nearly Sorted Data**: Performs well on nearly sorted lists, as it can stop early if no swaps are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-Time Systems**: Suitable for applications requiring predictable performance, as it has a consistent O(n²) time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Simplicity in Implementation**: Useful for quick scripts where code clarity is prioritized over performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Stable Sort**: Maintains the relative order of equal elements, making it useful in situations where stability is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "While not efficient for large datasets, Bubble Sort has niche applications primarily in education and specific small-scale scenarios."
