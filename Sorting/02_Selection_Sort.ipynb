    "\n",
    "2. **Small Datasets**: Effective for sorting small lists (typically fewer than 10 elements) where performance is not critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory Constraints**: Requires minimal additional memory since it sorts in place, making it suitable for environments with limited memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simple Implementation**: Useful in scenarios where ease of implementation is prioritized over efficiency, such as quick scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **When Stability is Not Required**: While not a stable sort, it can be used when the order of equal elements is not a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection Sort is not efficient for large datasets, but it serves well in niche applications, particularly in educational contexts and for small, memory-constrained environments."
